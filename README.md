## Description
Crypter generates a key which is used to encrpyt a text file and converts the encrypted file into morse codes. This happens in the follwing steps
- creates key a by shuffling the available characters(95) and making a one-one map for encryption
- encrypts the text file using the above key
- converts the encrypted text into morse code(check [Notes](#notes) for the tree used)

While decrptying it just uncovers the layers in the opposite order using the key. So, ideally the key is shared between individuals/parties offline(privately) and messages(text files) can be shared between them publicly. The key has 95!(facotrial) combinations which by brute qould require 10^147 combinations to crack.
